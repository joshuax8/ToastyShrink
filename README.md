# ToastyShrink

Use by running `/toastyshrink` ingame. A simple Fabric mod (currently `1.16.5`) that reads Minecraft commands (one per line) from the config file (in `%GAMEFOLDER%/config/toastyshrink.cfg`).
There's no need to restart the game after changing the config file because it is re-read every time you execute the `/toastyshrink` command.
